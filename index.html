            <p class="my-5"> The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a
                then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have
                originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in
                humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been traced to
                viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to
                become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may
                reveal how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.

                But they have data only on confirmed cases, so they can’t count people who don’t get COVID-19 tests.
                Experts also don’t have information about the outcome of every infection. However, early
                estimates predict that the overall COVID-19 recovery rate is between 97% and 99.75%.
